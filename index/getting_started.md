There are 4 ways through which you can install ewwii:

- Through your package manager (recommended).
- Building yourself (recommended if not available on your package manager).
- Through the installer.
- Installing via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

## Via Package Manager

Ewwii is currently available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/). So if you are on Arch Linux, then you can install ewwii using your favourite aur package manager.

Using Yay:

```bash
$ yay -S ewwii
```

Using Paru:

```bash
$ paru -S ewwii
```

## Building from source

If you are not on Linux or does not have ewwii available in your package manager, then this is the recommended approach for you. But before you continue, make sure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed.

### **Step-1:** Cloning

To start off, you should clone the repository of ewwii.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/ewwii.git
```

### Step-2: Checkout the cloned repository

Enter into the cloned repository with `cd`.

```bash
$ cd ewwii
```

### Step-3: Building

Now that you are in the ewwii source code. Run the following command to start building it:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

### Step-4: Moving to `/usr/local/bin`

Now that you compiled ewwii, you can find a binary named `ewwii` in `./target/release/`. Now you have to copy that to `/usr/local/bin` so that it will be globally accessable.

```bash
$ sudo cp ./target/release.ewwii /usr/local/bin/
```

## Using the installer

This is the simplest and fastest method through which you can install ewwii.

Simply run the following command and follow the instructions to have them installed in no time:

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://ewwii-sh.github.io/install.sh | install.sh
```

## Installing through Cargo

Installing ewwii through cargo is not really recommended because it installs them to `~/.cargo/bin` which is not a global destination. Sure, you may be able to access it, but other programs may not.

If really want to install through cargo, then you can run the commands shown below to install ewwii.

Installing ewwii through cargo:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/ewwii
```

## Next steps

Now that you have ewwii, you can move on to the next step--reading the documentation.
